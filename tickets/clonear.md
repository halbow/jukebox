This file marks the folder as a Clonear project; the board refuses folders
without it. `version` is the clonear.md format version (semver), `name` is
the display name, and `columns` is the column order (each column is a
subfolder).

## Tickets

A ticket is `<column>/<ID>.md`, e.g. `todo/TIC-7.md`. The filename stem is the
id (`TIC-<next number>`); the folder it sits in is its status. To move a
ticket, move the file to another column folder.

## Template

Every field filled in. Only `title` is required; unknown keys are kept.
